						<h2>What Are We Developping?</h2>
						<p>We are developping the best and the last handheld dermotoscope you will ever use. With an
							integrated high-resolution camera and an IPS screen you will be able to capture your images
							without needing any assistance from a third party device such as a smartphone. No more
							buying new accesories for your dermotoscope each time you are changing to a new smartphone
							or giving an arm and a leg to get a tool to get your job done. We are also developping a
							cloud platform accompanied with state-of-the-art artificial intelligence solution to give
							you the metrics you need to diagnose a patient and not get in you way with you and your
							patient. </p>

				<h2>Our Aim</h2>
				<p>We are more than excited for a change towards easier and faster skin disease detection by aiding our
					practioners with their diagnosis process</p>
				<div class="features">
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-code"></span>
						<h3>Intelligent Code</h3>
						<p>Boring stuff is boring. No matter who you are. And your time is precious. We know that.
							That's why we will deliver you an intelligent code that can automate your most tedious tasks
							so that you can concentrate on enhancing your patients' quality of life. The platform
							accompanying our product has everything you need to get the diagnosis done, fast. We know
							you are cautious. That's why we will not get in your way. We will only deliver a risk score
							on top of every tool, you need such as automatic evolution control and automatic assessments
							of asymmetry, border, color, and diameter of the lesion with our state-of-the-art computer
							vision algorithms.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-lock"></span>
						<h3>Secure Above All</h3>
						<p>
							"I see or hear in the life of men, which ought not to be spoke abroad, I will not divulge,
							as reckoning that all such should be kept secret.". We couldn't agree more! That's why our
							platform is fully encrypted and secure although benefitting from a cloud structure. We are
							using state-of-the-art double encryption technology. Only you will be able to see the
							patient's data. The data in our servers will be fully anonymized so that the identifying
							data only stays with you and everything else will only further our learning giving you
							better results each time.
						</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-cog"></span>
						<h3>Better Handheld Dermotoscope</h3>
						<p>We are on your side. We will not charge you an arm and a leg for essentially a light
							magnifier. Our innovative approach to handheld dermatoscopy will deliver a unified and
							high-quality image stream with our high-resolution integrated camera. Suitable for all cases
							whether it's a macro image of the body or micro imaging capabilities which can deliver a
							range of zoom between 10x up to 200x. Equipped with a polarized lens and infrared
							sensor for even deeper analysis. Everything you need from a dermatoscopy with a reasonable
							price tag.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon solid major fa-desktop"></span>
						<h3>A Better Experience</h3>
						<p>Your dermatologist friend uses the new device that is so much easier to use and yours looks
							like something out of a YouTube parody account of Star Trek? We are fully committed to the
							enhancement of your experience. These are your tools so you should be as comfortable as
							possible with the user interface that you are given. That's why we work with UI (User
							Interface) and UX (User Experience) experts to deliver you a better product to use above
							everything else that you are used to. It will be so good that you will never even think
							about
							it...</p>

						<span class="icon solid major fa-phone-square"></span>
						<h3>Repairable Hardware, Serviceable Software</h3>
						<p>If it ain't broke do not fix it. If it is broken though, or any other issues that you might
							have
							down the line, we are providing 24/7 support for the issues you might encounter or just
							any questions or remarks you would like us to hear about. We are more than happy to help you
							out with getting the most out of your device and the accompanying software platform.</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<span class="icon major fa-gem"></span>
						<h3>Sky Is The Limit</h3>
						<p>A responsible adaptation of the newer technology always benefits both you and your patients.
							In the 21st century, both software technology and hardware technology becomes only more
							capable. We are ready to responsibly adapt each new technology and create deliverable
							products for you. Be the best version of yourself and leave the boring technology mumbo
							jumbo for
							us. We will go through academic tech literature and will create deliverable and clinically
							applicable products if and only if it will enhance your experience.</p>
